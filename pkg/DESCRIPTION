Title: Interactive Health Visualization Development
Description: The healthvis package is designed to make it easy to create and
    publish interactive visualizations, with a focus on health visualizations.
    The functions in the healthvis package create HTML pages with embedded
    interactive graphics built with the Javascript library D3.js
    (http://d3js.org/). They can be directly plotted on your local machine,
    published to healthvis.org, and embedded directly into other websites. To
    see all currently available plots use the command listHealthVis().
